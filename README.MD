# Abstract
Multibeam forward-looking sonar (MFLS) has facilitated a wide range of real-word applications and attracted more and more attention in the field of underwater robotics. However, existing methods have merely focused and ignored trackers' capabilities to be deployed in multi-beam forward-looking sonar. In this paper, we first propose a new MFLS single object tracking (MFLS2oT) dataset with 50 videos and 15,842 frames under unconstrained conditions. These MFLS videos were recorded from real underwater missions and pose significant new challenges, such as fake target, approximate trace, tugboat wake, and random rays, to the existing video tracking algorithms. Thus, 11 scenario attributes are defined for short-term tracking evaluation on MFLS. To deal with the new challenge attributes, we designed a novel correlation filter-based tracker with the combination of temporal context, truncated $\ell_{1}$-$\ell_{2}$ sparsity and aberrances repression, named TCL1-L2ARDCF. Furthermore, we benchmark the performance of 25 state-of-the-art single object tracking algorithms. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that our TCL1-L2ARDCF achieves superior tracking performance on the proposed benchmark. The findings of the experiments provide some guidelines for future research. Dataset and the evaluation results are available at https://github.com/phan1007/MFLS50.
# Principle of Multibeam Forward-looking Sonar
Multibeam forward-looking sonar is an active acoustic sensor that sends out sound pulses to probe and receive reflections from the scene. Considering a 3D point $[x y z]^{T}$ in local Cartesian sonar coordinate frame. The point can be parameterized in the local spherical sonar coordinate system $ Q=\left[ r,\ \theta ,\ \phi \right] ^T $ as follows
